    <!- Try building a new body here, bootstrap is a wise choice ->
    <div class="px-5 py-5 mx-auto">
        <h1 class="text-primary"><strong>Group Project</strong></h1>
        <p class="text-secondary">The overall goal of our project is to use a fun interactive game to show off our group's ability to work together and our coding expertise. Our plan for our project is to make a game which involves the user to go through an escape room. The user will be able to go through several scenarios which will all lead to different outcomes. We plan to make the game very interactive and enjoyable for everybody to play. Each decision the user makes changes the course of what their outcome is going to be to make it more fun and creative. To meet the college board's requirements, we intend to make our game extremely difficult, and we'll make sure that everyone can grasp the coding and explain it.
